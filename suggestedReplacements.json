To manage changes to the website configuration of an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` resource instead. If you use `website` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the configuration of the website of the S3 bucket, treating additional website configuration changes as drift. For this reason, `website` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket."
