+ description: |-
+   Get information on a EC2 host.
+ ---
+ 
+ # Data Source: aws_dedicated_host
+ 
+ Use this data source to get information about the host when allocating an EC2 Dedicated Host.
+ 
+ ## Example Usage
+ 
+ ```hcl
+ # Create a new host with instance type of c5.18xlarge with Auto Placement 
+ # and Host Recovery enabled. 
+ provider "aws" {
+   region = "us-west-2"
+ }
+ 
+ resource "aws_dedicated_host" "test" {
+   instance_type     = "c5.18xlarge"
+   availability_zone = "us-west-1a"
+   host_recovery     = "on"
+   auto_placement    = "on"
+ }
+ 
+ data "aws_dedicated_host" "test_data" {
+   host_id = "${aws_dedicated_host.test.id}"
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Argument Reference
+ 
+ The following arguments are supported:
+ 
+ * `auto_placement` - (Optional) Indicates whether the host accepts any untargeted instance launches that match its instance type configuration, or if it only accepts Host tenancy instance launches that specify its unique host ID.
+ * `availability_zone` - (Optional) The AZ to start the host in.
+ * `host_recovery` - (Optional) Indicates whether to enable or disable host recovery for the Dedicated Host. Host recovery is disabled by default.
+ * `instance_type` - (Optional) Specifies the instance type for which to configure your Dedicated Hosts. When you specify the instance type, that is the only instance type that you can launch onto that host. 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ ### Timeouts
+ 
+ The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:
+ 
+ * `create` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when launching the host (until it reaches the initial `running` state)
+ * `update` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when stopping and starting the host when necessary during update - e.g. when changing host type
+ * `delete` - (Defaults to 20 mins) Used when terminating the host
+ 
+ 
+ ## Attributes Reference
+ 
+ In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
+ 
+ * `host_id` - The host ID. 
+ * `cores` - The number of cores on the Dedicated Host.
+ * `instance_family` - The instance family supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, m5.
+ * `instance_type` -The instance type supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, m5.large. If the host supports multiple instance types, no instanceType is returned.
+ * `sockets` - The instance family supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, m5.
+ * `total_vcpus` - The total number of vCPUs on the Dedicated Host.
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ ## Import
+ 
+ hosts can be imported using the `host_id`, e.g.
+ 
+ ```
+ $ terraform import aws_dedicated_host.host_id h-0385a99d0e4b20cbb
+ ```

+ 
+ # Resource: aws_dedicated_host
+ 
+ Provides an EC2 host resource. This allows hosts to be created, updated,
+ and deleted.
+ 
+ ## Example Usage
+ 
+ ```hcl
+ # Create a new host with instance type of c5.18xlarge with Auto Placement 
+ # and Host Recovery enabled. 
+ provider "aws" {
+   region = "us-west-2"
+ }
+ 
+ resource "aws_dedicated_host" "test" {
+   instance_type     = "c5.18xlarge"
+   availability_zone = "us-west-1a"
+   host_recovery     = "on"
+   auto_placement    = "on"
+ }
+ 
+ data "aws_dedicated_host" "test_data" {
+   host_id = "${aws_dedicated_host.test.id}"
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Argument Reference
+ 
+ The following arguments are supported:
+ 
+ * `auto_placement` - (Optional) Indicates whether the host accepts any untargeted instance launches that match its instance type configuration, or if it only accepts Host tenancy instance launches that specify its unique host ID.
+ * `availability_zone` - (Optional) The AZ to start the host in.
+ * `host_recovery` - (Optional) Indicates whether to enable or disable host recovery for the Dedicated Host. Host recovery is disabled by default.
+ * `instance_type` - (Optional) Specifies the instance type for which to configure your Dedicated Host. When you specify the instance type, that is the only instance type that you can launch onto that host. Mutually exclusive with `instance_family`.
+ * `instance_family` - (Optional) Specifies the instance family for which to configure your Dedicated Host. Mutually exclusive with `instance_type`.
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ ### Timeouts
+ 
+ The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:
+ 
+ * `create` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when launching the host (until it reaches the initial `running` state)
+ * `update` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when stopping and starting the host when necessary during update - e.g. when changing host type
+ * `delete` - (Defaults to 20 mins) Used when terminating the host
+ 
+ 
+ ## Attributes Reference
+ 
+ In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
+ 
+ * `host_id` - The host ID.
+ 
+ 
+ ## Import
+ 
+ hosts can be imported using the `host_id`, e.g.
+ 
+ ```
+ $ terraform import aws_dedicated_host.host_id h-0385a99d0e4b20cbb
+ ```

For example an `aws_route` resource can be created with an `aws_nat_gateway` or `aws_egress_only_internet_gateway` ID specified for the `gateway_id` attribute. Specifying anything other than an `aws_internet_gateway` or `aws_vpn_gateway` ID will lead to Terraform reporting a permanent diff between your configuration and recorded state, as the AWS API returns the more-specific attribute. If you are experiencing constant diffs with an `aws_route` resource, the first thing to check is that the correct attribute is being specified.

+ # Resource: aws_s3_bucket
+ 
+ Provides a S3 bucket resource.
+ 
+ -> This functionality is for managing S3 in an AWS Partition. To manage [S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3onOutposts.html), see the `aws_s3control_bucket` resource.
+ 
+ ## Example Usage
+ 
+ ### Private Bucket w/ Tags
+ 
+ ```terraform
+ resource "aws_s3_bucket_legacy" "b" {
+   bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
+   acl    = "private"
+ 
+   tags = {
+     Name        = "My bucket"
+     Environment = "Dev"
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Static Website Hosting
+ 
+ ```terraform
+ resource "aws_s3_bucket_legacy" "b" {
+   bucket = "s3-website-test.mydomain.com"
+   acl    = "public-read"
+   policy = file("policy.json")
+ 
+   website {
+     index_document = "index.html"
+     error_document = "error.html"
+ 
+     routing_rules = <<EOF
+ [{
+     "Condition": {
+         "KeyPrefixEquals": "docs/"
+     },
+     "Redirect": {
+         "ReplaceKeyPrefixWith": "documents/"

+ 
+ * `date` (Optional) Specifies the date after which you want the corresponding action to take effect.
+ * `days` (Optional) Specifies the number of days after object creation when the specific rule action takes effect.
+ * `expired_object_delete_marker` (Optional) On a versioned bucket (versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended bucket), you can add this element in the lifecycle configuration to direct Amazon S3 to delete expired object delete markers. This cannot be specified with Days or Date in a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.
+ 
+ The `transition` object supports the following
+ 
+ * `date` (Optional) Specifies the date after which you want the corresponding action to take effect.

+ 
+ The `replication_configuration` object supports the following:
+ 
+ ~> **NOTE:** See the `aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration` resource documentation to avoid conflicts. Replication configuration can only be defined in one resource not both.  When using the independent replication configuration resource the following lifecycle rule is needed on the `aws_s3_bucket_legacy` resource.
+ 
+ ```
+ lifecycle {
+   ignore_changes = [
+     replication_configuration
+   ]
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ * `role` - (Required) The ARN of the IAM role for Amazon S3 to assume when replicating the objects.

+ 
+ The `rules` object supports the following:
+ 
+ ~> **NOTE:** Amazon S3's latest version of the replication configuration is V2, which includes the `filter` attribute for replication rules.
+ With the `filter` attribute, you can specify object filters based on the object key prefix, tags, or both to scope the objects that the rule applies to.
+ Replication configuration V1 supports filtering based on only the `prefix` attribute. For backwards compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the V1 configuration.
+

+ ## Attributes Reference
+ 
+ In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
+ 
+ * `id` - The name of the bucket.
+ * `arn` - The ARN of the bucket. Will be of format `arn:aws:s3:::bucketname`.
+ * `bucket_domain_name` - The bucket domain name. Will be of format `bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com`.
+ * `bucket_regional_domain_name` - The bucket region-specific domain name. The bucket domain name including the region name, please refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) for format. Note: The AWS CloudFront allows specifying S3 region-specific endpoint when creating S3 origin, it will prevent [redirect issues](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=216814) from CloudFront to S3 Origin URL.
+ * `hosted_zone_id` - The [Route 53 Hosted Zone ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_website_region_endpoints) for this bucket's region.
+ * `region` - The AWS region this bucket resides in.
+ * `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
+ * `website_endpoint` - The website endpoint, if the bucket is configured with a website. If not, this will be an empty string.
+ * `website_domain` - The domain of the website endpoint, if the bucket is configured with a website. If not, this will be an empty string. This is used to create Route 53 alias records.
+ 
+ ## Import
+ 
+ S3 bucket can be imported using the `bucket`, e.g.,
+ 
+ ```
+ $ terraform import aws_s3_bucket_legacy.bucket bucket-name
+ ```
+ 
+ The `policy` argument is not imported and will be deprecated in a future version of the provider. Use the `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource to manage the S3 Bucket Policy instead.
